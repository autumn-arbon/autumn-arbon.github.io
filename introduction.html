            I started taking Computer Science classes at Snow College in 2018 and transferred to USU in 2019. Since then,
            I have learned to use different programming languages such as: C++, Java, Python, 
            Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I have also done some programming using PHP for an internship. Some of the 
            courses I have taken are Web Development, Mobile App Development, Software Engineering,
            and Compiler Construction. In my software engineering class, I worked with a group to create a website for users
            to reserve parking spots around USU's campus. Here are a few pictures of the website's home page:
