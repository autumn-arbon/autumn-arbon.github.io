        <p>Hello! My name is Autumn and I am in my last semester at Utah State University.
            I am working on a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I was originally planning
            on going into Math Education, but after living in Austin, Texas around a lot of tech
            jobs I realized that this is my passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been married for 2 and a half years and have a 4 month old baby boy. I love 
            spending time with my family and doing fun things with them. We like to be outside and
            enjoy nature together. We also love to travel and see new places. One of our first big 
            trips as a family of 3 was to the East Coast where we visited Washington D.C.
        </p>
